#+Title: TigerVNCviewer setup

* TigerVNCServer Setup
Follow the tutorial at
https://websiteforstudents.com/install-and-configure-vnc-server-on-ubuntu-16-04-18-04/
for a baseline setup.

Setup your EC2 instance.

** Modifications

*** Enable cut/paste
- install the autocutsel package:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get install autocutsel
#+END_SRC

*** Update ~/.vnc/xstartup
- We need to add ~/usr/bin/autocutsel -s CLIPBOARD -fork~
- A minimal startup looks like

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
/usr/bin/autocutsel -s CLIPBOARD -fork
startxfce4 &
#+END_SRC

*** Restart your vncserver

* Download the Portable Java-based Viewer
- https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.9.0
  - ~VncViewer-1.9.0.jar~
- Alternately, look in the s3 bucket

* Setup VNCViewer
- ensure java 1.8> is installed.
- 2x click to launch.
** First/main window
  - Vnc Server: 127.0.0.1:5901
** Options
*** Compression
Leave this alone for now.  You can mess with these settings if there's too much
latency (e.g. shift color levels to Medium, use less data, or play with 
compression settings).
*** Security
Leave defaults.
*** Input
- Accept clipboard from server: true
- Send clipboard to server: true
*** Screen

    - hostname : hostname or ip address of the server you'll ssh to
    - port : 22 (default)
** Wrap up
- Hit "ok<-|" button to return to initial menu.
- Save your profile just in case (it will autosave the last recent settings).
** Connection
- Select "connect <-|" button
- Primary screen will disappear, to be followed by a login prompt:
  - This prompt is your SSH login to your user account on the server.
  - Log in as if you were SSH'ing into your account.
- A secondary login will appear asking for your password:
  - This prompt is your Xwindows login
  - This was set up during the VNCServer setup.
    - If you forgot it / messed up, you can setup the password again.
  - This password is local to the VNCServer.
- You should have a display of an XWindows desktop pop up.
  - Right click, "Open Terminal Here" to start an XWindows terminal.
  - You can now use xwindows GUI apps, setup your dev environment, etc.
