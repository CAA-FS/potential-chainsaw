** Factors
ARFORGEN (GLOBAL)
*** ACPolicy  
  - {1:n forall n in [0 ... 8]}
  - |ACPolicy| = 9
*** RCPolicy
  - {1:n forall n in [1 ... 8]}
  - |RCPolicy| = 8
*** NGPolicy
  - RCPolicy
  - |NGPolicy| = 8
** BY SRC
*** Supply (Indepenent)
- AC-Supply = [0 ... 300]
- RC-Supply = [0 ... 300]
- NG-Supply = [0 ... 300]

- |ACx RC x NG| = 27,000,000
*** Consistent Mix (Requirements Analysis)
Mix = 
- AC = 0.3
- RC = 0.2
- NG = 0.2

Mix * alpha = [AC-Supply RC-Supply NG-Supply]
- forall alpha in [0 ... 300] ?

*** Demand (Peak)
- Dp = [0 ... 300] ?

** Additional Factors
*** Surge Policies 
- AC-s = [1:n forall n in (n < ACPolicy)] = 8
- RC-s = [1:n forall n in (n < RCPolicy)] = 7
- NG-s = [1:n forall n in (N < NGPolicy)] = 7

*** Post Surge Policies
- AC-p = [1 ... n forall n in (ACS<= N <= ACPolicy)] = 8?
- RC-p = [1 ... n  forall n in (RCS <= N <= RCPolicy)] = 7
- NG-p = [1 ... n forall n in (NGS <= N <= NGPolicy)] = 7

* Distributed Cluster
** AWS
 - ~10cents / hour for T2 Large
 - 10 machines @ 5 hours -> 4.64
 - $8/day = 1 cluster
